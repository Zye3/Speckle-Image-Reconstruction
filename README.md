Our approach first characterises the MMF and retrieves images using a RVITM algorithm, followed by refinement with a Hierarchical, Parallel Multi-Scale (HPM)-Attention U-Net to improve image quality. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach achieved high-quality reconstructions, with Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values of up to 0.9524 and 33.244 dB, respectively. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6bc4eb2-79aa-41d2-9fb4-8abd04d4b43d)
